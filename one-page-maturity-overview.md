# Asynchronous communications maturity model (overview)

Adapted from the [Rethinking async communications maturity model](https://github.com/amatlack/rethinking-async-communications/blob/main/maturity-model.md)

| **Level** | **Documentation** | **Decision Making** | **Work Tracking** | **Meetings** | **Leadership & Culture** |
|----------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Level 3: Optimizing** | Documentation is a living resource, continuously refined and fully integrated into workflows, ensuring all decisions and processes are clear and easily accessible. | Decisions are thoroughly documented, fully transparent, and routinely reviewed for improvement, involving broad stakeholder participation. | Work tracking is seamlessly integrated with workflows, utilizing automation to streamline updates and ensure visibility across teams, with tasks clearly linked to decisions and documentation. | Meetings are used sparingly and intentionally, reserved for high-impact discussions, complex problem-solving, or team bonding, with clear agendas and follow-up documentation. | Leaders model async-first behavior, working transparently, promoting autonomy, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement and trust. |
| **Level 2: Defined** | Documentation is consistently updated and embedded in workflows, reducing interruptions and enabling team members to work autonomously across time zones. | Decisions are regularly documented and accessible, fostering greater involvement and ensuring clarity across teams. | Teams use centralized work-tracking tools to maintain visibility and accountability, with clear ownership of tasks and regular updates. | Meetings are focused and intentional, primarily for social connections, 1:1s, or complex discussions, with agendas and outcomes well-documented and shared. | Leaders champion async communication, encouraging transparency, inclusivity, and psychological safety, with clear expectations for async-first practices. |
| **Level 1: Initial** | Teams begin documenting decisions and processes, but practices are inconsistent and lack structure, with gaps in accessibility and ownership. | Some decisions are documented, but the process is ad hoc, and teams often rely on meetings for clarification and follow-ups. | Work tracking is inconsistent, with tasks scattered across different tools and some progress still shared via meetings or chat. | Teams hold frequent meetings for status updates and decision-making, though async alternatives are occasionally used. | Leaders experiment with async methods but may default to synchronous communication, sending mixed signals about expectations. |
| **Level 0: Unaware** | Documentation is sparse or nonexistent, with teams relying on meetings and verbal communication for sharing information and making decisions. | Decisions are informal, undocumented, and siloed, leading to frequent confusion and misalignment among teams. | Work tracking is absent or informal, with no durable records of progress, making cross-team collaboration difficult. | Meetings are the default method for all communication, decision-making, and coordination, with no effort to use async alternatives. | Leadership prioritizes synchronous communication and immediate responses, with little effort to foster an async-friendly environment or culture. |
