# Rethinking async communications: Maturity model

This maturity model aims to help remote teams assess and improve their asynchronous communication practices, moving from reliance on real-time, synchronous methods to embracing asynchronous-first workflows. It provides a clear framework for understanding your current practices and identifies steps to gradually optimize communication, maximize time spent in flow state, and empower teams to work more autonomously across time zones.

The model breaks down key aspects of async communication into levels, with each level building on the previous one. Each level of maturity reflects key behaviors, processes, and tools related to core principles of asynchronous communication, as described in [“Rethinking async communications”](./async-communications-for-remote-teams.md). By focusing on improving documentation, decision-making, work tracking, meetings, and leadership, teams can shift toward more effective, sustainable async practices.

## How to use this model

1. **Assess your current practices**: Identify where your team currently stands by reviewing the maturity levels for each category.
2. **Set improvement goals**: Use the higher levels as a guide to develop actionable steps for advancing your async communication practices.
3. **Track progress**: Revisit this model regularly to measure progress and ensure your team is continuously improving.

# Async communications maturity model

The model covers five key areas that impact async communication:

- **Documentation**  
- **Decision making**  
- **Work tracking**  
- **Meetings**  
- **Leadership and culture**  

Each category is divided into four maturity levels:

- **Level 0 (Unaware)**: Teams rely heavily on synchronous communication and have not adopted async practices.
- **Level 1 (Initial)**: Teams are experimenting with async communication, but practices are inconsistent and not fully integrated.
- **Level 2 (Defined)**: Async communication is a core part of how teams work, with clear guidelines and practices in place.
- **Level 3 (Optimizing)**: Teams are continuously refining and optimizing async processes to maximize efficiency and reduce reliance on synchronous communication.

## Documentation

Clear, accessible documentation is the backbone of effective async communication. [Giving everything a URL](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/) ensures that decisions, processes, and knowledge are always available to the team, regardless of location or time zone. As teams mature, documentation becomes well-maintained, central to workflows, and integrated into the team's culture.

### Level 0: Unaware
- Documentation is inconsistent or non-existent, and the team relies heavily on meetings and verbal communication.
- Key decisions and information often go undocumented, creating confusion and misalignment.
- Interruptions are frequent, as team members regularly seek clarification or updates that aren't readily available in written form.

### Level 1: Initial
- Teams are beginning to recognize the need for documentation, but lack a consistent process for capturing and maintaining it.
- Documentation is scattered and often incomplete, making it difficult to find and use.
- There’s no clear ownership or guidelines for when and how to document key decisions or processes.

### Level 2: Defined
- Documentation is integrated into the team’s workflow. Most decisions, processes, and knowledge are written down in an accessible location.
- Teams follow guidelines on maintaining documentation, and it is regularly updated as part of everyday work.
- Written documentation reduces the need for interruptions, enabling team members to operate more autonomously across time zones.

### Level 3: Optimizing
- Documentation is a critical, well-maintained resource that the team relies on for efficient async collaboration.
- Teams continuously improve and refine documentation, treating it as a living resource.
- There are clear ownership and review processes for documentation, ensuring it stays up-to-date and relevant.

## Decision making

In an async-first environment, decisions must be captured in durable, accessible formats to avoid bottlenecks and ensure transparency. As teams mature, decisions become more inclusive and consistently documented, visible to all stakeholders, and easily referenced for future needs.

### Level 0: Unaware
- Decisions are made informally in meetings or through verbal conversations, often without written documentation.
- Teams frequently need to follow up to clarify decisions, as they are not documented or accessible to everyone.
- Decisions are communicated only to those directly involved, leading to silos and a lack of transparency.

### Level 1: Initial
- Teams begin to document some decisions, but the process is inconsistent and varies across projects or teams.
- Documentation of decisions is often incomplete or scattered, making it difficult for team members to access the necessary information.
- Decisions are not consistently recorded in a durable, searchable format, limiting involvement and transparency.

### Level 2: Defined
- Decisions are consistently documented in durable, accessible formats (e.g., issues, PRs, or wikis), ensuring transparency and clarity.
- Teams have established guidelines for how and where decisions should be documented, reducing confusion and ambiguity.
- More team members are involved in the decision-making process due to the increased visibility and accessibility of decisions.

### Level 3: Optimizing
- Decision-making processes are thoughtfully structured for async collaboration. Every decision is documented in a durable, searchable format, and all decisions are linked to their respective work or tasks (e.g., via URLs in tracking tools).
- Decisions are fully transparent, enabling broader involvement from stakeholders and fostering a culture of collaboration.
- Teams regularly review decision-making processes to improve efficiency and ensure documentation remains current and relevant.

## Work tracking

[How we work is as important as what we work on](https://ben.balter.com/2023/01/10/manage-like-an-engineer/#what-it-means-to-manage-like-an-engineer). As teams mature, they adopt more transparent and unified ways to track progress, ensuring clarity across teams and reducing the need for real-time updates.

### Level 0: Unaware
- Work tracking is inconsistent or nonexistent. Progress is shared in direct messages or verbally through meetings, causing delays and confusion.
- Teams track work in different tools, making it difficult to collaborate or understand the status of work.
- Tasks are often scattered in emails or chat, leaving little to no durable record of progress or decisions.

### Level 1: Initial
- Teams start using work-tracking tools, but adoption is inconsistent. Some tasks are still tracked in chat, making it hard to create durable records.
- Different teams may use separate tools to track work, causing silos and making cross-team collaboration difficult.
- Status updates still occur primarily through meetings, limiting visibility and creating gaps between teams.

### Level 2: Defined
- Work is consistently tracked in a centralized tool (e.g., GitHub, JIRA, Trello, Linear), with clear ownership and regular updates.
- Cross-team collaboration improves as work and progress are more visible, and efforts are made to align tools or create bridges between them.
- Guidelines exist for maintaining up-to-date task boards, ensuring that teams can easily track and follow progress.

### Level 3: Optimizing
- Work tracking is fully integrated into the team's workflow, with automated updates and reporting minimizing the need for synchronous communication.
- Tools are optimized for cross-team collaboration, with tasks clearly linked to decisions and documentation, ensuring visibility and transparency across teams.
- Teams continuously refine their work-tracking practices to maintain efficiency and visibility, even as they scale across different projects and tools.

## Meetings

In an async-first environment, meetings should be used sparingly and intentionally, primarily for informal social calls, or as [escalation points](https://ben.balter.com/2023/04/20/meetings-are-a-point-of-escalation/) when asynchronous methods aren’t sufficient. As teams mature, they shift from relying on meetings for everyday coordination to reserving them for high-impact discussions, problem-solving, and in-person interactions that strengthen collaboration.

### Level 0: Unaware
- Meetings are the default method for sharing information, making decisions, and coordinating tasks.
- Teams frequently hold meetings to initiate projects or track progress, relying heavily on synchronous communication.
- In-person meetings, if held, are ad hoc and lack clear purpose, focusing solely on immediate deliverables.

### Level 1: Initial
- Teams start experimenting with async alternatives, but still hold frequent meetings for status updates and decision-making.
- Agendas and outcomes are sometimes documented, but meetings are still the primary way work progresses.
- Offsites begin to incorporate relationship-building elements, but are often scheduled around business outcomes without a strategic focus.

### Level 2: Defined
- Meetings are reserved for social calls, 1:1s, complex discussions, problem-solving, or situations where real-time interaction is necessary.
- Agendas and outcomes are consistently documented, and recordings of virtual meetings are shared for those unable to attend, promoting transparency and accessibility.
- Offsites are planned intentionally, balancing relationship-building with work that benefits most from in-person interaction, such as brainstorming, aligning on vision, and addressing complex strategic decisions.

### Level 3: Optimizing
- Meetings are used only for high-impact, human-centered interactions (e.g., conflict resolution, deep problem-solving, or team-building).
- Most work happens asynchronously by default, with meetings serving as escalation points for complex issues. Agendas are shared in advance, notes are documented afterward, and recordings are made available.
- Offsites are highly intentional, blending business outcomes with opportunities for in-person bonding. These are used strategically for work that’s best done in person (e.g., strategic planning, high-level decision-making), and to foster deeper team connections, driving long-term business success.

## Leadership and culture

Strong leadership and a transparent, inclusive culture are essential to sustaining async-first practices. [Leaders play a pivotal role](./tips-for-leaders.md) in shaping how teams communicate and collaborate, creating an environment that fosters trust, autonomy, and psychological safety.

### Level 0: Unaware
- Leadership is unaware of the benefits of async communication and models behavior that prioritizes synchronous methods.
- There is little focus on psychological safety, and the culture values immediate responses over thoughtful, async contributions.
- The organization lacks clear communication guidelines, and inclusivity and transparency are not prioritized.

### Level 1: Initial
- Leaders begin experimenting with async communication, but might still default to synchronous methods, leading to mixed signals.
- Efforts to promote transparency and inclusivity are inconsistent, and the importance of psychological safety is recognized, but not fully embraced.
- Leaders occasionally encourage async questions and feedback, but synchronous interactions remain dominant.

### Level 2: Defined
- Leaders champion async communication and set clear expectations for async-first behaviors. They model this behavior by being intentional in their own communication practices.
- Leadership cultivates a culture of inclusivity and transparency, with leaders ensuring that information is accessible and all team members feel empowered to contribute asynchronously.
- Leaders work openly, documenting decisions and processes visibly so the team can provide feedback and stay aligned. Leaders foster psychological safety, encouraging asynchronous feedback and open discussions about mistakes and improvements.

### Level 3: Optimizing
- Leadership fully embraces async principles, continuously refining communication practices to promote efficiency, autonomy, and trust. They prioritize asynchronous collaboration over instant responses, ensuring a thoughtful, reflective communication culture.
- Leaders work transparently, openly sharing their decision-making processes and inviting feedback. This openness helps build trust and encourages a collaborative, learning-focused environment.
- The culture of continuous improvement is fully embedded, with teams iterating on async practices and providing ongoing feedback to leadership. Teams feel empowered to work autonomously, and leadership responds to feedback to optimize communication and collaboration practices.
