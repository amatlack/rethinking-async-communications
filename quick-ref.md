# Rethinking async communications: Quick reference guide

This document is a quick-reference companion to the full ["Rethinking async communications" document](./async-communications-for-remote-teams.md). For more details on anything noted here, as well as background, purpose, and usage information, please see the full set of guidance.

## Guiding principles

Successful remote work requires intentional communication, grounded in the following core principles (fully defined in the ["Rethinking async communications" document](./async-communications-for-remote-teams.md)):
- Be asynchronous first
- Write things down
- Make work visible and overcommunicate
- Prefer tools that capture and expose process
- Embrace collaboration
- Foster a culture that values documentation maintenance
- Communicate openly, honestly, and authentically
  - Strive for inclusivity
  - Use emoji
- Remember practicality beats purity

## Communications channels

In brief, here's which communication channel to use for which purpose (more details in the ["Rethinking async communications" document](./async-communications-for-remote-teams.md)):

## Chat

Chat platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) are ideal for real-time coordination, quick questions, and informal conversations, but they are not suitable for critical decision-making or as a long-term source of truth. Use chat for water-cooler talk, tactical coordination, and time-sensitive matters best handled semi-synchronously. Prefer public channels over private DMs, and be sure to document any important outcomes in a more durable format afterward.

## Work-tracking tools

**Issues/tasks** are the atomic units of work. Use issues or tasks (depending on your tool) to plan, track, manage, and communicate the progress of work. They serve as permanent, searchable records (they give work a URL) and help ensure visibility across teams.

**Project boards** provide a high-level view of work progress, showing what's planned, in progress, and completed. They help teams stay aligned and organized on tasks.

**Pull requests (PRs)** (or their equivalent) are the primary means by which changes to code, documentation, or other materials are proposed and reviewed. They facilitate collaboration and ensure that changes are reviewed and approved in a structured way.

## Google Docs

Google Docs are great for early ideation, collaborative drafting, and gathering feedback. However, they are not ideal for long-term or canonical documentation due to limited discoverability and state tracking. Once an idea is ready for broader sharing or finalization, move the content to a more durable platform like a project tracking tool or knowledge repository.

## Live meetings

Live meetings (video or in-person) are helpful for situations where synchronous communication is needed — such as brainstorming, working through complex problems, resolving interpersonal issues, or providing feedback. Human conversations deserve the warmth of human faces. However, meetings should be reserved for moments when asynchronous methods aren’t enough. And always document decisions made during meetings afterward.

## Video recordings

For one-way communication (e.g., readouts, demos, or announcements that don’t require interaction), record and share videos instead of holding live meetings. Whenever possible, record meetings and share the recording for those who couldn't attend. Providing transcripts alongside videos makes it easier to find specific information.

## Email

Email should be used sparingly, and primarily for sensitive discussions or external communications. Whenever possible, use more transparent tools like issues or chat for internal conversations. Email is not well suited for collaboration or as a record of organizational knowledge.
