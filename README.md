# Rethinking async communications: Principles and practices for remote teams

In 2020, many companies were thrust into remote work almost overnight, reacting to the pandemic without time to plan or adjust. Instead of intentionally rethinking how they worked, most organizations simply moved in-person rituals — like synchronous meetings and constant check-ins — into a virtual space. As a result, many teams found themselves surviving, but not thriving.

But remote work is about more than just location; it’s a mindset shift. Done well, remote work doesn’t just replicate old workflows online — it transforms them. There’s much we can learn from companies like GitHub, which have always been remote-first. Their experience can help us master the art of asynchronous work, allowing distributed teams to collaborate smoothly across time zones, minimizing disruptions, and maximizing productivity.

The docs in this repository draw inspiration [from GitHub’s experience](https://github.com/github/how-engineering-communicates) to offer practical guidance on improving the quality and efficiency of communication in a remote-first world. These recommendations are designed as a core foundation to help teams move away from defaulting to synchronous practices. Teams are encouraged to adapt them to fit their specific needs, while maintaining a shared “API” for seamless cross-team communication.

As remote work continues to evolve, so too will this guidance. Contributions and improvements are not just welcome — [they’re encouraged](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
