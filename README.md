# Rethinking async communications: Principles and practices for remote teams

In 2020, many companies were thrust into remote work almost overnight, reacting to the pandemic without time to plan or adjust. Instead of intentionally rethinking how they worked, most organizations simply moved in-person rituals — like synchronous meetings and constant check-ins — into a virtual space. As a result, many teams found themselves surviving, but not thriving.

But remote work is about more than just location; it’s a mindset shift. Done well, remote work doesn’t just replicate old workflows online — it transforms them. Mastering the art of asynchronous work allows distributed teams to collaborate smoothly across time zones, minimizing disruptions and maximizing productivity.
